\subsection{Serialization} 

There are lots of serialization methods for tabular data. Many works try to
embed row-wise or column-wise for understanding the structure of tabular data.

Understanding the structure of the tabular data somewhat important. However, I
could not find any related works the performance of learning the tabular data
structure. TaBERT uses utternance.

In our work, we only uses the linearzation of table to see the effectiveness of
tables.
