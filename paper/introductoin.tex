\section{Introduction}
Understanding relation between columns are imporatnt for data lake data analysis.

What could be the useful relationship for models?
- use prompt or table to text.
- current data use existing table -> instruction tuning?

How about adding more information to the model? When humans try to interpret
table, we usually see the caption, table title, column values, and relationship
between columns.

The caption is a sort of summarization of table. Even when the column header/type is missing
we can summarize the table.
: or the metadata could be enough.

train with wikitables, masking column headers, training with relationship
between columns, 

Table itself understanding very good. But need metadata while training. But how
about learning from multiple tables?snetence embedding get their success from
comparing their sentences like SBERT or SimCSE. However, in the table data, it
is hard to find similar dataset such as NLI data SBERT or SimCSE used. 

However, in the sense of understanding hypothesis can derive premise, in the
tabular data, we can use groupby as the proof of understanding the table. Note
that this is the first trial of using a pair of tables to understand a table.
